Company Description:
BSCPLC is primarily the only Submarine Cable operator connecting the country to the rest of the world. It is the member SEA-ME-WE-4, 5, and 6 (to be connected).

BSCPLC started the journey of providing IP transit connectivity services (Internet Service Provider) from 1st July 2013 in Bangladesh. BSCPLC has been providing quality IP bandwidth to International Internet Gateway (IIG) operators under its ILDC operator license and ISP customers under an IIG operator license. 

To provide this quality Internet bandwidth, BSCPLC has deployed its Network Devices at Equnix in Singapore and has connected with global Tier-1 Internet Service Providers and regional Tier-1 Internet Service Providers based on customer needs. BSCPLC's Autonomous System AS-132602 is connected to around 200 (Autonomous System) networks around the world. BSCPLC has interconnectivity of 100 Gbps, 40 Gbps, or 10 Gbps, with all these networks based on the requirement. BSCPLC ensured uninterrupted bandwidth supply to its IP transit customers through two submarine cables landing at two different locations and offering the best price. We guarantee the speedy delivery of seamless service, along with simplifying the process of selling our products.

The company is committed to providing 24/7 technical support provided by our skilled Network Operations Center to simplify customers' network operations to ensure customer satisfaction.

Project issues:
- As the organization uses technical support for the customer on a 24/7-365 basis, we can work with it.
- It has several processes to solve customer issues and also working/troubleshooting its network.
- This issue-solving process takes different types of micro work, from finding the issue to optimizing it or completely solving it.
- An Engineer needs to take information from different places (for example, network devices, customer devices, port status, transmission link status etc.) to identify and solve the issue.
- The main problem for the organization is that, these informations are scattered and it takes a long time to only gather the information, then jump into the troubleshooting process.

Project Idea:
- Building a web-based platform where a support engineer will find all information together and he/she don't need to manually find it by accessing the network devices/inventories/customer information.
- This software will store all data in a database.
- This software will be able to fetch data from a network device directly and provide some basic port information
- There will be options to integrate further microservices to the software, so that we can add new requirements as needed.
